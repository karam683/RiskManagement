# @sap/eslint-plugin-cds


The [ESLint](https://eslint.org) plugin includes a set of recommended [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap) model and environment rules.	The aim of CDS linting is to catch issues with CDS models and with the environment early.


<!-- See the [CDS Linting documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/tools/lint) for more details, or jump directly to a complete [list of rules](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/tools/lint#rules).	CAP provides a set of recommended rules.  On top, you can create your own, application-specific rules. -->
